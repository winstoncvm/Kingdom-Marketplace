= SPEC-1: Kingdom Marketplace Barter Platform
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The Kingdom marketplace is designed to allow businesses in the Kingdom of God to exchange services without the need for traditional financial resources. By introducing a platform-specific currency (Kingdom Coin), businesses can barter services, contributing to a faith-driven kingdom economy. This platform aims to foster collaboration, where each business fulfills another’s needs using tokens instead of cash.

== Requirements

*Must Have*:
- A token-based bartering system (Kingdom Coin) where businesses exchange services for tokens.
- User registration and business profiles where businesses can list services and offer tokens for service exchange.
- An easy-to-use form submission for businesses to join the marketplace and list their services.
- Customizable ICO pages that serve as business service listings.
- Escrow and transaction management to ensure fairness in token exchanges.
- MVP launch by October 14th for businesses to sign up and submit services.

*Should Have*:
- Dynamic token valuation based on performance metrics such as project completion rates (to be added after MVP launch).
- A performance tracking system with token-based rewards and penalties (post-launch).

== Method

1. **Token Creation and Management**:
    - Develop a unified cryptocurrency called **Kingdom Coin** as the platform’s primary medium of exchange.
    - Ensure each business transaction is conducted using Kingdom Coin.

2. **Service Listing**:
    - Adapt the ICO listing page template to allow businesses to list their services, set prices in Kingdom Coins, and describe the services they offer.
    - Include sections for business descriptions, token values per service, and links to their websites or promotional content.

3. **Form Submission**:
    - Create a form where businesses can submit details to be approved for listing. Capture necessary fields such as business name, description, services offered, and token price for each service.

4. **Escrow and Transaction Management**:
    - Implement a basic escrow system where tokens for a service are held securely until the service is completed. This ensures both parties in the transaction are protected.
    - Enable users to view their transaction history, including services offered and tokens earned or spent.

5. **Customization of ICO Pages**:
    - Modify the theme’s ICO pages to reflect the service marketplace structure, where each listing represents a business offering services for tokens rather than cryptocurrency ICOs.
    - Ensure each business has a detailed profile that showcases their services and the exchange rates in Kingdom Coin.

== Detailed Technical Plan

This section breaks down the specific **technical fields, field groups, actions**, and **WordPress development concepts** you’ll need to implement the Kingdom Marketplace.

=== 1. **Custom Post Types for Service Listings**

WordPress will need a **custom post type** for businesses to create service listings. This custom post type will be based on the ICO pages in your Numismatico theme but modified to represent **service listings**.

- **Post Type Name**: `service_listing`
- **Label**: `Service Listings`
- **Capabilities**: Add/edit/view listings for businesses.

*Example Code to Create the Post Type*:
```php
function create_service_listing_cpt() {
    register_post_type( 'service_listing',
        array(
            'labels' => array(
                'name' => __( 'Service Listings' ),
                'singular_name' => __( 'Service Listing' )
            ),
            'public' => true,
            'has_archive' => true,
            'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'services'),
            'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'),
            'show_in_rest' => true,
        )
    );
}
add_action( 'init', 'create_service_listing_cpt' );
``` 

=== 2. Custom Fields for Service Listings

You’ll need to add custom fields to capture service details for each business. Use a plugin like ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) or manually create these fields using WordPress's meta box functions.

Field Group: Service Details
Field 1: Service Name
Type: Text
Field 2: Service Description
Type: Text Area
Field 3: Token Price (Kingdom Coin)
Type: Number
Field 4: Service Category
Type: Dropdown (e.g., Graphic Design, Financial Services, etc.)
Field 5: Business Website
Type: URL
Field 6: Business Contact Information
Type: Email / Phone
Example of ACF field setup in PHP:

```php
if( function_exists('acf_add_local_field_group') ):

acf_add_local_field_group(array(
    'key' => 'group_service_listing',
    'title' => 'Service Details',
    'fields' => array(
        array(
            'key' => 'field_service_name',
            'label' => 'Service Name',
            'name' => 'service_name',
            'type' => 'text',
        ),
        array(
            'key' => 'field_service_description',
            'label' => 'Service Description',
            'name' => 'service_description',
            'type' => 'textarea',
        ),
        array(
            'key' => 'field_token_price',
            'label' => 'Token Price (Kingdom Coin)',
            'name' => 'token_price',
            'type' => 'number',
        ),
        array(
            'key' => 'field_service_category',
            'label' => 'Service Category',
            'name' => 'service_category',
            'type' => 'select',
            'choices' => array(
                'graphic_design' => 'Graphic Design',
                'financial_services' => 'Financial Services',
                // Add more categories as needed
            ),
        ),
        array(
            'key' => 'field_business_website',
            'label' => 'Business Website',
            'name' => 'business_website',
            'type' => 'url',
        ),
        array(
            'key' => 'field_contact_information',
            'label' => 'Contact Information',
            'name' => 'contact_information',
            'type' => 'text',
        ),
    ),
    'location' => array(
        array(
            array(
                'param' => 'post_type',
                'operator' => '==',
                'value' => 'service_listing',
            ),
        ),
    ),
));

endif;
```
=== 3. Escrow System and Token Exchange

You’ll need an escrow system to ensure the Kingdom Coins are held until both parties confirm that the service has been completed.

Steps to Implement:

Escrow Table in the database:
Create a custom table to track the tokens held in escrow for each transaction.
Fields:
escrow_id: Unique ID
service_listing_id: Associated service listing
tokens_held: Number of tokens in escrow
status: Status of the transaction (Pending, Completed, Disputed)
SQL Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_escrow (
    escrow_id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    service_listing_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
    tokens_held DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    PRIMARY KEY (escrow_id)
);
```

Transaction Workflow:

When a business purchases a service, the tokens are held in the escrow table.
Upon service completion, the seller confirms delivery, and the tokens are released.
If there is a dispute, an admin can resolve the issue and either return the tokens to the buyer or release them to the seller.
Escrow Logic in PHP:

Create functions for adding to escrow, releasing tokens, and handling disputes.
=== 4. Business Submission Form

You can create a business submission form using Contact Form 7, WPForms, or custom code.

Form Fields:

Business Name
Business Description
Service(s) Offered
Token Price per Service
Business Website
Contact Information
Example of a custom form handler:

```php
function handle_business_submission() {
    if (isset($_POST['submit_business'])) {
        $business_name = sanitize_text_field($_POST['business_name']);
        $business_description = sanitize_textarea_field($_POST['business_description']);
        // Add other fields similarly

        // Insert as a new 'service_listing' post
        $post_id = wp_insert_post(array(
            'post_title' => $business_name,
            'post_content' => $business_description,
            'post_type' => 'service_listing',
            'post_status' => 'pending', // Submit for admin approval
        ));

        // Handle custom fields using update_post_meta()
        update_post_meta($post_id, 'token_price', sanitize_text_field($_POST['token_price']));
        // Add other custom fields as needed

        // Redirect or display success message
    }
}
add_action('admin_post_nopriv_submit_business', 'handle_business_submission');
add_action('admin_post_submit_business', 'handle_business_submission');

```
