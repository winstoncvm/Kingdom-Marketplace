= SPEC-2: Kingdom Marketplace Service Barter Platform
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The Kingdom marketplace is designed to allow businesses in the Kingdom of God to exchange services without the need for traditional financial resources. By introducing a platform-specific currency (Kingdom Coin), businesses can barter services, contributing to a faith-driven kingdom economy. This platform aims to foster collaboration, where each business fulfills another’s needs using tokens instead of cash.

== Requirements

*Must Have*:
- A token-based bartering system (Kingdom Coin) where businesses exchange services for tokens.
- User registration and business profiles where businesses can list services and offer tokens for service exchange.
- An easy-to-use form submission for businesses to join the marketplace and list their services.
- Customizable ICO pages that serve as business service listings.
- Escrow and transaction management to ensure fairness in token exchanges.
- MVP launch by October 14th for businesses to sign up and submit services.

*Should Have*:
- Dynamic token valuation based on performance metrics such as project completion rates (to be added after MVP launch).
- A performance tracking system with token-based rewards and penalties (post-launch).

== Method

1. **Token Creation and Management**:
    - Develop a unified cryptocurrency called **Kingdom Coin** as the platform’s primary medium of exchange.
    - Ensure each business transaction is conducted using Kingdom Coin.

2. **Service Listing**:
    - Adapt the ICO listing page template to allow businesses to list their services, set prices in Kingdom Coins, and describe the services they offer.
    - Include sections for business descriptions, token values per service, and links to their websites or promotional content.

3. **Form Submission**:
    - Create a form where businesses can submit details to be approved for listing. Capture necessary fields such as business name, description, services offered, and token price for each service.

4. **Escrow and Transaction Management**:
    - Implement a basic escrow system where tokens for a service are held securely until the service is completed. This ensures both parties in the transaction are protected.
    - Enable users to view their transaction history, including services offered and tokens earned or spent.

5. **Customization of ICO Pages**:
    - Modify the theme’s ICO pages to reflect the service marketplace structure, where each listing represents a business offering services for tokens rather than cryptocurrency ICOs.
    - Ensure each business has a detailed profile that showcases their services and the exchange rates in Kingdom Coin.

== Detailed Technical Plan

This section breaks down the specific **technical fields, field groups, actions**, and **WordPress development concepts** needed to implement the Kingdom Marketplace.

=== 1. **Custom Post Types for Service Listings**

WordPress will need a **custom post type** for businesses to create service listings. This custom post type will be based on the ICO pages in Numismatico theme but modified to represent **service listings**.

- **Post Type Name**: `service_listing`
- **Label**: `Service Listings`
- **Capabilities**: Add/edit/view listings for businesses.

*Example Code to Create the Post Type*:
```php
function create_service_listing_cpt() {
    register_post_type( 'service_listing',
        array(
            'labels' => array(
                'name' => __( 'Service Listings' ),
                'singular_name' => __( 'Service Listing' )
            ),
            'public' => true,
            'has_archive' => true,
            'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'services'),
            'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'),
            'show_in_rest' => true,
        )
    );
}
add_action( 'init', 'create_service_listing_cpt' );
