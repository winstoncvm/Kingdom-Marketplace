:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The Kingdom marketplace is designed to allow businesses in the Kingdom of God to exchange services without the need for traditional financial resources. By introducing a platform-specific currency (Kingdom Coin), businesses can barter services, contributing to a faith-driven kingdom economy. This platform aims to foster collaboration, where each business fulfills another’s needs using tokens instead of cash.

== Requirements

*Must Have*:
- A token-based bartering system (Kingdom Coin) where businesses exchange services for tokens.
- User registration and business profiles where businesses can list services and offer tokens for service exchange.
- An easy-to-use form submission for businesses to join the marketplace and list their services.
- Customizable ICO pages that serve as business service listings.
- Escrow and transaction management to ensure fairness in token exchanges.
- MVP launch by October 14th for businesses to sign up and submit services.

*Should Have*:
- Dynamic token valuation based on performance metrics such as project completion rates (to be added after MVP launch).
- A performance tracking system with token-based rewards and penalties (post-launch).

== Method

1. **Token Creation and Management**:
    - Develop a unified cryptocurrency called **Kingdom Coin** as the platform’s primary medium of exchange.
    - Ensure each business transaction is conducted using Kingdom Coin.

2. **Service Listing**:
    - Adapt the ICO listing page template to allow businesses to list their services, set prices in Kingdom Coins, and describe the services they offer.
    - Include sections for business descriptions, token values per service, and links to their websites or promotional content.

3. **Form Submission**:
    - Create a form where businesses can submit details to be approved for listing. Capture necessary fields such as business name, description, services offered, and token price for each service.

4. **Escrow and Transaction Management**:
    - Implement a basic escrow system where tokens for a service are held securely until the service is completed. This ensures both parties in the transaction are protected.
    - Enable users to view their transaction history, including services offered and tokens earned or spent.

5. **Customization of ICO Pages**:
    - Modify the theme’s ICO pages to reflect the service marketplace structure, where each listing represents a business offering services for tokens rather than cryptocurrency ICOs.
    - Ensure each business has a detailed profile that showcases their services and the exchange rates in Kingdom Coin.

== Implementation

1. **Week 1:**
    - Set up the WordPress environment with the Numismatico theme.
    - Develop the Kingdom Coin token system for basic exchanges.
    - Build the registration and profile system for businesses to list services.
    - Adapt ICO listing pages into business service pages, using Kingdom Coin pricing.

2. **Week 2:**
    - Develop the escrow system to hold Kingdom Coins during transactions and release them upon service completion.
    - Create a simple form submission flow for businesses to submit their information to be listed on the platform.

3. **Week 3:**
    - Customize business profile pages to include detailed service listings.
    - Implement transaction tracking for users (e.g., tokens earned, tokens spent).

4. **Week 4:**
    - Test user registration, service listing, and token exchange features.
    - Finalize and refine the escrow system.
    - Conduct user testing with initial businesses to ensure ease of use and correct functionality.
    - Prepare the platform for launch on October 14th.

== Milestones

1. **Week 1**: Finalize core MVP functionality: User registration, token system, service listing page customization.
2. **Week 2**: Complete the token management, escrow system, and form submission for business sign-up.
3. **Week 3**: Finalize business profile customization, transaction tracking, and escrow features.
4. **Week 4**: Conduct user testing, fix bugs, and prepare for launch.

== Gathering Results

Post-launch, evaluate the platform’s performance based on:
- The number of businesses registered and their service listings.
- Successful service transactions completed using Kingdom Coin.
- User feedback on the ease of service exchange, registration process, and escrow management.
- Assess the potential for integrating dynamic token valuation and performance-based rewards in future iterations.
